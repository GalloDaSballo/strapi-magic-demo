# strapi-magic-demo

Demo Strapi Project example of how to set up Strapi with Magic.Link for API requests

## Installation

### Clone the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/GalloDaSballo/strapi-magic-dev/
```

### Install Strapi Deps
``` 
npm i
```

There's a postinstall script that will install dependencies for the plugin and rebuild the admin
Check the package.json for more info

### Run Strapi
```
npm run develop
```


## Set up
This repo is already set up for you

Open /admin
Add your Magic SK

Open /public/magic.html
Add you Magic PK

Visit http://localhost:1337/magic.html
Add your email

Use the JWT to make an authenticated request

## Architecture
In order for Magic to work, you have to Customize the JWT Validation Function

Check `/extensions/users-permissions/config/policies` in this repo
The file `permissions.js` shows you the easiest way to set this up, you can't go wrong with this one

## Video Guide for manual installation:

## Manual installation:
Create the file 
`/extensions/users-permissions/config/policies/permissions.js`

Copy the "normal version"
https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-plugin-users-permissions/config/policies/permissions.js
The file looks like this
```
const _ = require('lodash');

module.exports = async (ctx, next) => {
  let role;
  //Add the code here
  if (ctx.state.user) {
```

Add the following code on line 5
```javascript
  /** With Magic Changes */
  await strapi.plugins['magic'].services['magic'].loginWithMagic(ctx)
  /** END With Magic Changes */
  
```

The resulting code should look like this:
```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

module.exports = async (ctx, next) => {
  let role;

  /** With Magic Changes */
  await strapi.plugins['magic'].services['magic'].loginWithMagic(ctx)
  /** END With Magic Changes */

  if (ctx.state.user) {
    // request is already authenticated in a different way
    return next();
  }

  //etc...
```

You can test the integration by retrieving a Magic ID Token
```javascript
//By logging in
const token = await m.auth.loginWithMagicLink({ email: 'hello@example.com' });

//By requesting the token, works if you are already logged in
const token = await m.user.getIdToken();
```

Then make a request
```javascript
fetch(`${STRAPI_URL}/articles`, { 
   method: 'post', 
   headers: new Headers({
     'Authorization': 'Bearer `${token}`, 
   }), 
   body: JSON.stringify({title: "He turned himself into a pickle"})
 });
```

### More info on this
https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/guides/jwt-validation.html#customize-the-jwt-validation-function

## Architecture
The Magic Plugin allows you to store your Secret Key

The Magic Plugine exposes a service you can use to verify if the bearer token belongs to a magic link related request.

After installing the plugin, use `loginWithMagic` like so:
```javascript
await strapi.plugins['magic'].services['magic'].loginWithMagic(ctx)
```

The service will attach the (Created or Retrieved user with the specific email) to the ctx.state.user object, hence logging the user in

## Security Considerations

### This plugin creates users automatically
This plugin automatically registers new users when they make their first request.
For the majority of website, this is a advantage.

For some websites it may not, if you do not wish to allow users to register via Magic Link, but only log in (using magic link as proof that the user can use that specific email), then submit an Issue or seek 1-1 mentoring for a custom solution.

### You are responsible for updating the permissions.js file
We purposefully have you set it up so you can more granularly customize the file.
Check periodicaly here and in the (https://github.com/strapi/strapi)[Strapi Monorepo] for changes to permissions.js
